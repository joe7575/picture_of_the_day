# Picture of the day [picture_of_the_day]

To change the picture on a daily basis, the script `dice_picture.py` has to be called once a day.
This also requires a server restart.

To add new pictures, copy the PNG file into the filter `store` and add PNG file name,
picture title, picture owner, and position of the object to the JSON file `pictures.json`.

The format of the PNG file images should be square. For the "picture of the day" it will
be converted to a texture with 256x256 pixels.
